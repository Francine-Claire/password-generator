## What is this?

Since security is one of the concerns in the digital world, having a password that can easily be guess is one of the main reasons why people almost always get hacked. The password generator automatically generates a random password for you based on your specified number of letters, numbers, and symbols. Due to its randomness, it would be hard to guess.
